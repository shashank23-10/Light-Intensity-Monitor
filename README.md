# Light Intensity Monitor 

Plants require a delicate balance of sunlight to thrive. Understanding and monitoring their light exposure is vital for their growth and overall well-being. This is where our Light Intensity Monitor comes into play. By connecting the Bolt WiFi Module with a 10K Ohm Resistor and LDR Sensor we have created a user-friendly and efficient solution to check the light intensity at a particular instant of time. ðŸŒ¼ðŸ”¬

With this system, users can effortlessly monitor and visualize the light intensity levels around their plants, enabling them to make informed decisions about optimizing their plant's environment. ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡
